Largest Odd Number in a String.



**Problem Statement:** Given a string s, representing a large integer, the task is to return the largest-valued odd integer (as a string) that is a substring of the given string s.  
The number returned should not have leading zero's. But the given input string may have leading zero.

**Examples**

**Example 1****Input:** s = "5347"
**Output:** "5347"
**Explanation:** The odd numbers formed by the given string are → 5, 3, 53, 347, 5347. The largest odd number without leading zeroes is 5347.

**Example 2****Input:** s = "0214638"
**Output:** "21463"
**Explanation:** The odd numbers formed by the string are → 1, 3, 21, 63, 463, 1463, 21463. We can't use numbers starting with 0, so the largest valid odd number is 21463.
            

Approach

Algorithm

- Focus on finding the longest valid odd number starting from the original string.
- An odd number must end with an odd digit, so we look for the last odd digit when scanning from the end.
- Leading zeroes don’t add value to the number, so we aim to remove them for a cleaner representation.
- Once the endpoint (last odd digit) is determined, we identify the starting point by skipping any leading zeroes before it.
- Extract the portion between these two positions, this gives the largest possible odd integer from the string.

C++JavaPythonJavaScript

```java
import java.util.*;

class Solution {
    // Returns the largest odd number substring from the given string
    public String largeOddNum(String s) {
        int ind = -1;

        // Find the last odd digit in the string
        int i;
        for (i = s.length() - 1; i >= 0; i--) {
            if ((s.charAt(i) - '0') % 2 == 1) {
                ind = i;
                break;
            }
        }

        // Return empty string if no odd digit was found
        if (ind == -1) return "";

        // Skip leading zeroes up to the odd digit
        i = 0;
        while (i <= ind && s.charAt(i) == '0') i++;

        // Return substring from first non-zero to odd digit
        return s.substring(i, ind + 1);
    }
}

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Solution solution = new Solution();
        String num = "504";
        String result = solution.largeOddNum(num);
        System.out.println("Largest odd number: " + result);
    }
}
```

Complexity Analysis

**Time Complexity: O(N)**, since the loop runs once through the string of length N.  
  
**Space Complexity: O(1)**, as we are using only a constant amount of extra space.
