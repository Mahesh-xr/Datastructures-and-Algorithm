Reverse Every Word in A String

**Problem Statement:** Given an input string, containing upper-case and lower-case letters, digits, and spaces( ' ' ). A word is defined as a sequence of non-space characters. The words in s are separated by at least one space.  
  
Return a string with the words in reverse order, concatenated by a single space.

**Examples**

**Example 1:****Input:** s = "welcome to the jungle"
**Output:** "jungle the to welcome"
**Explanation:**
The words in the input string are "welcome", "to", "the", and "jungle". Reversing the order of these words gives "jungle", "the", "to", and "welcome". The output string should have exactly one space between each word.

**Example 2:****Input:** s = " amazing coding skills "
**Output:** "skills coding amazing"
**Explanation:**
The input string has leading and trailing spaces, as well as multiple spaces between the words "amazing", "coding", and "skills". After trimming the leading and trailing spaces and reducing the multiple spaces between words to a single space, the words are "amazing", "coding", and "skills". Reversing the order of these words gives "skills", "coding", and "amazing". The output string should not have any leading or trailing spaces and should have exactly one space between each word.

Brute Force

Algorithm

- Start by scanning the string to identify words, treating each word as a group of characters separated by spaces.
- Store these words in a list, making sure to skip any extra or multiple spaces.
- After collecting all the words, reverse the order of the list.
- Join the reversed words using a single space between them.
- Ensure the final result has no leading or trailing spaces.

        Solution sol = new Solution();
        
        // Function call to reverse every word in the given string
        String ans = sol.reverseWords(s);
        
        // Output

Complexity Analysis

**Time Complexity: O(n)** (where n is the length of the input string). The input string is scanned once to extract words, taking O(n) time. Each word is stored in a list and then concatenated in reverse order, which also takes O(n).  
  
**Space Complexity: O(n)** since the words list stores each extracted word, requiring O(k) space, where k is the total number of characters in all words (essentially O(n)). The result string requires O(n) space as well.

Optimal Approach

Algorithm

- Begin by reversing the entire input string.
- Iterate over the reversed string to handle each word.
- Detect words as continuous sequences of characters separated by spaces.
- Reverse each identified word to restore its correct character order.
- Move the reversed word to the front while skipping extra spaces.
- Trim any trailing spaces before returning the final string.

Complexity Analysis

**Time Complexity: O(n)** (where n is the length of the input string).  

- The input string is reversed firstly, taking O(n) time.
- The string is then traversed taking another O(n) time.
- Every word encountered in the string is reversed, taking overall O(n) time.
  
**Space Complexity: O(1)** since there is no additional space used. The reversal is done in-place taking O(1) or constant space.  
  
**Note:** The space complexity for the Java solution will be O(N) because of the conversion of the given String to a character array. This is done because Strings are immutable in Java.
