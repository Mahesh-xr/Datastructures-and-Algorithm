Longest Palindromic Substring



**Problem Statement:** Given a string **s**, return the **longest palindromic substring** in s.

**Examples**

**Example 1:****Input:** s = "babad"
**Output:** "bab"
**Explanation:** It is the longest palindromic substring. "aba" is also a valid answer.

**Example 2:****Input:** s = "cbbd"
**Output:** "bb"
**Explanation:** It is the longest palindromic substring.

Approach

Algorithm

- The goal is to find the longest palindromic substring by treating each character (and each pair) as a potential center.
- Every palindrome is symmetric, so we expand outward from a center to check for symmetry.
- There are two types of centers to consider: one at a character (odd-length) and one between characters (even-length).
- For each center, expand left and right while the characters on both sides match.
- Keep track of the maximum length palindrome found by updating its start and end indices.
- The final result is the substring between the recorded boundaries of the longest expansion.

```java
class Solution {
    public String longestPalindrome(String str) {
        int start = 0, end = 0;

        // Iterate through each character as center
        for (int center = 0; center < str.length(); center++) {
            // Expand around odd length palindrome
            int lenOdd = expandFromCenter(str, center, center);
            // Expand around even length palindrome
            int lenEven = expandFromCenter(str, center, center + 1);
            // Get the max of both lengths
            int maxLen = Math.max(lenOdd, lenEven);

            // Update the longest palindrome boundaries
            if (maxLen > end - start) {
                start = center - (maxLen - 1) / 2;
                end = center + maxLen / 2;
            }
        }

        // Return the longest palindromic substring
        return str.substring(start, end + 1);
    }

    // Helper function to expand from the center
    private int expandFromCenter(String str, int left, int right) {
        while (left >= 0 && right < str.length() && str.charAt(left) == str.charAt(right)) {
            left--;
            right++;
        }
        return right - left - 1;
    }
}

class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Solution sol = new Solution();
        String input = "babad";
        System.out.println("Longest Palindromic Substring: " + sol.longestPalindrome(input));
    }
}
```
Complexity Analysis

**Time Complexity: O(N²)** For each character, expanding could take up to O(N)  
  
**Space Complexity: O(1)** No extra space used.
