Minimise Maximum Distance between Gas Stations

**Problem Statement:** You are given a sorted array ‘arr’ of length ‘n’, which contains positive integer positions of ‘n’ gas stations on the X-axis. You are also given an integer ‘k’. You have to place 'k' new gas stations on the X-axis. You can place them anywhere on the non-negative side of the X-axis, even on non-integer positions. Let 'dist' be the maximum value of the distance between adjacent gas stations after adding k new gas stations. Find the minimum value of ‘dist’.

**Examples**

Example 1:
Input Format: N = 5, arr[] = {1,2,3,4,5}, k = 4
Result: 0.5
Explanation: One of the possible ways to place 4 gas stations is {1,1.5,2,2.5,3,3.5,4,4.5,5}. Thus the maximum difference between adjacent gas stations is 0.5. Hence, the value of ‘dist’ is 0.5. It can be shown that there is no possible way to add 4 gas stations in such a way that the value of ‘dist’ is lower than this. 

Example 2:
Input Format: N = 10, arr[] = {1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10}, k = 1
Result: 1
Explanation: One of the possible ways to place 1 gas station is {1,1.5,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10}. Thus the maximum difference between adjacent gas stations is still 1. Hence, the value of ‘dist’ is 1. It can be shown that there is no possible way to add 1 gas station in such a way that the value of ‘dist’ is lower than this. 
            

Brute Force

Algorithm

## Approach

- First, we will declare an array ‘howMany[]’ of size n-1, to keep track of the number of placed gas stations.
- Next, using a loop we will pick k gas stations one at a time.
- Then, using another loop, we will find the index 'i' where the distance (arr[i+1] - arr[i]) is the maximum and insert the current gas station between arr[i] and arr[i+1] (i.e. howMany[i]++).
- Finally, after placing all the new stations, we will find the distance between two consecutive gas stations. For a particular section, distance = section_length / (number_of_stations_ inserted+1) = (arr[i+1]-arr[i]) / (howMany[i]+1)
- Among all the distances, the maximum one will be the answer.

        int[] howMany = new int[n - 1]; // Number of gas stations in each segment

        // Place each gas station
        for (int gasStations = 1; gasStations <= k; gasStations++) {
            double maxSection = -1;
            int maxInd = -1;

            // Find the segment with the maximum distance
            for (int i = 0; i < n - 1; i++) {
                double diff = arr[i + 1] - arr[i];
                double sectionLength = diff / (howMany[i] + 1.0);

                if (sectionLength > maxSection) {
                    maxSection = sectionLength;
                    maxInd = i;
                }
            }

            // Add gas station to the selected segment
            howMany[maxInd]++;
        }

        // Find the final max section length after placing all gas stations
        double maxAns = -1;
        for (int i = 0; i < n - 1; i++) {
            double diff = arr[i + 1] - arr[i];
            double sectionLength = diff / (howMany[i] + 1.0);
            maxAns = Math.max(maxAns, sectionLength);

        int k = 4;

        GasStationSolver solver = new GasStationSolver();
        double ans = solver.minimiseMaxDistance(arr, k);

        System.out.println("The answer is: " + ans);

Complexity Analysis

Time Complexity: O(k*n) + O(n), n = size of the given array, k = no. of gas stations to be placed.

Space Complexity: O(n-1) as we are using an array to keep track of placed gas stations.

Better Approach

Algorithm

## Intuition

In the previous approach, for every gas station, we were finding the index i for which the distance between arr[i+1] and arr[i] is maximum. After that, our job was to place the gas station. Instead of using a loop to find the maximum distance, we can simply use the heap data structure i.e. the priority queue.

## Approach

- First, we will declare an array ‘howMany[]’ of size n-1, to keep track of the number of placed gas stations and a priority queue that uses max heap.
- We will insert the first n-1 indices with the respective distance value, arrr[i+1]-arr[i] for every index.
- Next, using a loop we will pick k gas stations one at a time.
- Then we will pick the first element of the priority queue as this is the element with the maximum distance. Let’s call the index ‘secInd’.
- Now we will place the current gas station at ‘secInd’(howMany[secInd]++) and calculate the new section length, new_section_length = initial_section_length / (number_of_stations_ inserted+1) = (arr[secInd+1] - arr[secInd]) / (howMany[i] + 1)
- After that, we will again insert the pair into the priority queue for further consideration.
- After performing all the steps for k gas stations, the distance at the top of the priority queue will be the answer as we want the maximum distance.

```java
import java.util.*;

class Pair {
    double distance;
    int index;

    Pair(double distance, int index) {
        this.distance = distance;
        this.index = index;
    }
}

class Solution {
    public double minimiseMaxDistance(int[] arr, int k) {
        int n = arr.length;
        int[] howMany = new int[n - 1];

        // Priority queue (max-heap) to store the largest segment first
        PriorityQueue<Pair> pq = new PriorityQueue<>(
            (a, b) -> Double.compare(b.distance, a.distance)
        );

        // Add initial segments
        for (int i = 0; i < n - 1; i++) {
            pq.add(new Pair(arr[i + 1] - arr[i], i));
        }

        // Place k additional gas stations
        for (int gasStations = 1; gasStations <= k; gasStations++) {
            Pair top = pq.poll();
            int idx = top.index;
            howMany[idx]++;

            double totalDist = arr[idx + 1] - arr[idx];
            double newDist = totalDist / (howMany[idx] + 1);
            pq.add(new Pair(newDist, idx));
        }

        // Return max distance after placing k stations
        return pq.peek().distance;
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int[] arr = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};
        int k = 4;
        Solution sol = new Solution();
        System.out.println("The answer is: " + sol.minimiseMaxDistance(arr, k));
    }
}
```
Complexity Analysis

Time Complexity: O(nlogn + klogn), n = size of the given array, k = no. of gas stations to be placed.

Space Complexity: O(n-1)+O(n-1). The first O(n-1) is for the array to keep track of placed gas stations and the second one is for the priority queue..

Optimal Approach

Algorithm

- First, we will find the maximum distance between two consecutive gas stations i.e. max(dist).
- Place the 2 pointers i.e. low and high: Initially, we will place the pointers. The pointer low will point to 0 and the high will point to max(dist).
- Now, we will use the ‘while’ loop like this: while(high - low > 10^(-6)).
- Calculate the ‘mid’: Now, inside the loop, we will calculate the value of ‘mid’ using the following formula: mid = (low+high) / 2.0
- Eliminate the halves based on the number of stations returned by numberOfGasStationsRequired(): We will pass the potential value of ‘dist’, represented by the variable 'mid', to the ‘numberOfGasStationsRequired()' function. This function will return the number of gas stations we can place.

- If result > k: On satisfying this condition, we can conclude that the number ‘mid’ is smaller than our answer. So, we will eliminate the left half and consider the right half(i.e. low = mid).
- Otherwise, the value mid is one of the possible answers. But we want the minimum value. So, we will eliminate the right half and consider the left half(i.e. high = mid).

- Finally, outside the loop, we can return either low or high as their difference is beyond 10^(-6). They both can be the possible answer. Here, we have returned the ‘high’.
