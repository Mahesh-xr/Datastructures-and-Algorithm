Mark as Completed

143

**Problem Statement:**  
Given an integer array arr of size N, sorted in ascending order (with distinct values), the array is rotated at any index which is unknown. Find the minimum element in the array.

**Pre-requisites:** [Search in Rotated Sorted Array I](https://takeuforward.org/data-structure/search-element-in-a-rotated-sorted-array/),  [Search in Rotated Sorted Array II](https://takeuforward.org/arrays/search-element-in-rotated-sorted-array-ii/) & [Binary Search algorithm](https://takeuforward.org/data-structure/binary-search-explained/)

**Examples**

Input: arr = [4,5,6,7,0,1,2,3]
Output: 0
Explanation: The minimum element in the array is 0.

Input : arr = [3,4,5,1,2]
Output: 1
Explanation : The minimum element in the array is 1.
            

**_Disclaimer_**: _It's highly recommend trying to solve it before looking at the solution._

Brute-Force Approach

Algorithm

**How does rotation occurs?**  
  
Let's consider a sorted array: {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}. If we rotate this array at index 3, it will become: {4, 5, 1, 2, 3}. In essence, we moved the element at the last index to the front, while shifting the remaining elements to the right. We performed this process twice.

One straight forward approach we can use is linear search algorithm. We can simply traverse the entire array and check for the minimum element in the array.

```java
class Solution {
    // Function to find the minimum element using linear search
    public int findMin(int[] nums) {

        // Initialize answer with a large number
        int minVal = Integer.MAX_VALUE;

        // Traverse each element
        for (int i = 0; i < nums.length; i++) {

            // Update minimum value
            minVal = Math.min(minVal, nums[i]);
        }

        // Return the result
        return minVal;
    }
}

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {

        // Input array
        int[] nums = {4, 5, 6, 7, 0, 1, 2};

        // Create object of Solution
        Solution sol = new Solution();

        // Call function and store result
        int result = sol.findMin(nums);

        // Output the result
        System.out.println("Minimum element is " + result);
    }
}
```
Complexity Analysis**Time Complexity: O(N)**, we check every element once.  
**Space Complexity: O(1)**, constant additonal space is used.

Optimal Approach

Algorithm

In a rotated sorted array, the smallest element represents the point of rotation. It is the only element that is smaller than its previous element. Since the array is sorted in two segments, we can use binary search to efficiently find this pivot point. By comparing the middle element with the rightmost element in the current search space, we can determine which half of the array contains the minimum element.

- Initialize pointers to the start and end of the array.
- While start is less than end, calculate the middle index.
- If the middle element is greater than the rightmost element, move the start to mid + 1.
- Else, move the end to mid (because mid can be the minimum).
- When the loop ends, start will point to the minimum element.

```java
class Solution {
    // Function to find the minimum element using binary search
    public int findMin(int[] nums) {

        // Initialize low and high pointers
        int low = 0, high = nums.length - 1;

        // Binary search loop
        while (low < high) {

            // Calculate mid index
            int mid = low + (high - low) / 2;

            // Check which half to discard
            if (nums[mid] > nums[high]) {

                // Minimum lies in right half
                low = mid + 1;

            } else {

                // Minimum lies in left half (including mid)
                high = mid;
            }
        }

        // Return the minimum element
        return nums[low];
    }
}

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {

        // Input array
        int[] nums = {4, 5, 6, 7, 0, 1, 2};

        // Create object of Solution
        Solution sol = new Solution();

        // Call function and store result
        int result = sol.findMin(nums);

        // Output the result
        System.out.println("Minimum element is " + result);
    }
}
```
Complexity Analysis**Time Complexity: O(logN)**, at every step the search space is reduced to half using binary search.  
**Space Complexity: O(1)**, constant additonal space is used.
