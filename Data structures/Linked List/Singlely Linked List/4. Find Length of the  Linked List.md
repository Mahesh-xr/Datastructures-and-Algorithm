**Problem Statement:** Given the head of a linked list, print the length of the linked list.

**Examples**

Input: 0->1->2 Output: 3Explanation: The list has a total of 3 nodes, thus the length of the list is 3.

Input: 12->5->8->7Output: 4Explanation: The list has a total of 4 nodes, thus the length of the list is 4.

Approach

Algorithm

The simple idea to solve this problem is to traverse the linked list and count the number of nodes using a counter.

- Initialize a temporary pointer to the head of the list. The temporary pointer will be used to traverse the list.
- Traverse the linked list until the the current node is not null.
- At every node, increment the counter to count number of nodes.
- After reaching the end of the linked list, return the count. This will be your total number of nodes which is the length of the linked list.

C++JavaPythonJavaScript

```java
// Node class to represent each element in the linked list
class Node {
    int data;
    Node next;

    // Constructor to initialize data and next pointer
    Node(int data1) {
        data = data1;
        next = null;
    }
}

// Solution class containing the method to find length
class Solution {
    // Function to find the length of the linked list
    public int lengthOfLinkedList(Node head) {
        // Initialize counter to 0
        int count = 0;

        // Initialize a temporary pointer to head
        Node temp = head;

        // Traverse the linked list
        while (temp != null) {
            // Increment count for each node
            count++;

            // Move to the next node
            temp = temp.next;
        }

        // Return the total count
        return count;
    }
}

// Main class to run the program
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Creating a sample linked list
        Node head = new Node(10);
        head.next = new Node(20);
        head.next.next = new Node(30);

        // Create Solution object
        Solution obj = new Solution();

        // Find and print the length of linked list
        System.out.println("Length of Linked List: "
                           + obj.lengthOfLinkedList(head));
    }
}
```
Complexity Analysis**Time Complexity: O(N)**, we traverse the entire linked list once to find the total number of nodes.  
**Space Complexity: O(1)** , we use fixed number of pointers and variables to find the length of linked list.
