### Recap of Linked List

Before exploring doubly linked lists, let's refresh our knowledge of linked lists. Linked lists are linear data structures consisting of nodes, **each containing data and a reference (or pointer) to the next node.** This setup allows for dynamic memory allocation and efficient insertions and deletions.

A significant characteristic of singly linked lists is their **unidirectional** **nature**, allowing **traversal in only one direction i.e forward**. Moving backward, such as going from node at 3rd position to node at 1st position is not possible because each node in a singly linked list holds two pieces of information: **the data** (an integer value in this case) and **a pointer** that indicates the address **of the next node**. This structure enables efficient forward navigation, but the absence of a backward pointer restricts reverse traversal.

Code for Singly Linked List

C++JavaPythonJavaScript

```java
// Node class represents a node in the linked list
class Node {
    int data;      // Data value
    Node next;     // Pointer to next node

    // Constructor with data and next
    Node(int data1, Node next1) {
        data = data1;
        next = next1;
    }

    // Constructor with only data
    Node(int data1) {
        data = data1;
        next = null;
    }
}

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Create an array
        int[] arr = {2, 5, 8, 7};

        // Create first node
        Node y = new Node(arr[0]);

        // Print memory reference of node
        System.out.println(y);

        // Print data stored in node
        System.out.println(y.data);
    }
}
```

The code for Singly Linked List creates a class Node which has two **member variables:**

1. **int data:** This holds the data value that the node stores, which can be of any data type (in this case, an integer).

2. **Node* next:** This is a pointer to the next node in the linked list. It allows the nodes to be linked together, forming a sequence.

The class has two **constructors**:

1. The first constructor takes **both the data and a pointer to the next node** as parameters. It initializes the data and the next node accordingly.

2. The second constructor takes only the **data as a parameter** and **sets it next to nullptr.** It could be that this node is the end of the list since there is no reference to the next node. We can append the next of this node later **adding more nodes to the linked list.**

### Doubly Linked List

Doubly Linked Lists,  as the name suggests, allows **2-way traversal** by **introducing two pointers in each node**. This **enables seamless traversal in both directions**, making them a valuable tool for various advanced data structure applications.

Code for Doubly Linked List

C++JavaPythonJavaScript

```java
import java.util.*;

// Class representing a node in Doubly Linked List
class Node {
    // Stores data of the node
    int data;

    // Pointer to the next node
    Node next;

    // Pointer to the previous node
    Node prev;

    // Constructor when data, next and prev are provided
    Node(int data1, Node next1, Node prev1) {
        data = data1;
        next = next1;
        prev = prev1;
    }

    // Constructor when only data is provided
    Node(int data1) {
        data = data1;
        next = null;
        prev = null;
    }
}

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Initializing an array to create nodes
        int[] arr = {2, 5, 8, 7};

        // Creating the head node of the doubly linked list
        Node head = new Node(arr[0]);

        // Printing the memory reference of head
        System.out.println(head);

        // Printing the data stored in head node
        System.out.println(head.data);
    }
}
```

**Node* prev :** The introduction of the previous pointer is the key change from a singly linked list node. This pointer allows **traversal in the backward direction**, making it suitable for doubly linked lists.

**Constructors:** Both constructors have been updated to initialize the new previous pointer. In the first constructor, Node(int data1, Node* next, Node* prev), prev is initialized with the provided value. In the second constructor, Node(int data1), **the prev is initialized to nullptr, just like the next.**

These changes differentiate the Node class for a doubly linked list, allowing it to maintain **bidirectional links between nodes**, as opposed to the unidirectional links in a singly linked list node.
