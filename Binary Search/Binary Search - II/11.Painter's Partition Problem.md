**Problem Statement:** Given an array/list of length ‘N’, where the array/list represents the boards and each element of the given array/list represents the length of each board. Some ‘K’ numbers of painters are available to paint these boards. Consider that each unit of a board takes 1 unit of time to paint. You are supposed to return the area of the minimum time to get this job done of painting all the ‘N’ boards under the constraint that any painter will only paint the continuous sections of boards.

**Examples**

Example 1:
Input Format: N = 4, boards[] = {5, 5, 5, 5}, k = 2
Result: 10
Explanation: We can divide the boards into 2 equal-sized partitions, so each painter gets 10 units of the board and the total time taken is 10.

Example 2:
Input Format: N = 4, boards[] = {10, 20, 30, 40}, k = 2
Result: 60
Explanation: We can divide the first 3 boards for one painter and the last board for the second painter.
            


Brute Force Approach

Algorithm

- First, we will find the maximum element and the summation of the given array.
- We will use a loop(say time) to check all possible answers from max(arr[]) to sum(arr[]).
- Next, inside the loop, we will send ‘time’, to the function countPainters() function to get the number of painters to whom we can allocate the boards.
- The first value of ‘time’, for which the number of painters will be lesser or equal to ‘k’, will be our answer. So, we will return that particular value of ‘time’.
- Finally, if we are out of the loop, we will return max(arr[]) as there cannot exist any answer smaller than that.

```java
import java.util.*;

public class PainterPartition {

    // Function to count how many painters are required if each painter paints at most 'time' units
    public int countPainters(int[] boards, int time) {
        int painters = 1;         // Start with one painter
        int boardsPainter = 0;    // Time consumed by current painter

        for (int board : boards) {
            if (boardsPainter + board <= time) {
                // Assign board to current painter
                boardsPainter += board;
            } else {
                // Assign board to next painter
                painters++;
                boardsPainter = board;
            }
        }

        return painters;
    }

    // Function to find the minimum possible maximum time to paint all boards using k painters
    public int findLargestMinDistance(int[] boards, int k) {
        int low = Arrays.stream(boards).max().getAsInt();  // Largest single board
        int high = Arrays.stream(boards).sum();            // Sum of all boards

        for (int time = low; time <= high; time++) {
            if (countPainters(boards, time) <= k) {
                return time;  // Found a valid minimum time
            }
        }

        return low;  // Fallback (shouldn't usually reach here)
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int[] boards = {10, 20, 30, 40};  // Length of boards
        int k = 2;  // Number of painters

        PainterPartition pp = new PainterPartition();
        int ans = pp.findLargestMinDistance(boards, k);

        System.out.println("The answer is: " + ans);  // Expected: 60
    }
}

Complexity Analysis- Time Complexity: O(N * (sum(arr[])-max(arr[])+1)), where N = size of the array, sum(arr[]) = sum of all array elements, max(arr[]) = maximum of all array elements.
- Space Complexity: O(1), no extra space used.

Optimal Approach

Algorithm

- Place the 2 pointers i.e. low and high: Initially, we will place the pointers. The pointer low will point to max(arr[]) and the high will point to sum(arr[]).
- Calculate the ‘mid’: Now, inside the loop, we will calculate the value of ‘mid’ using the following formula: mid = (low+high) // 2 ( ‘//’ refers to integer division.
- Eliminate the halves based on the number of painters returned by countPainters(): We will pass the potential value of time, represented by the variable 'mid', to the ‘countPainters()' function. This function will return the number of painters we need to paint all the boards

- If painters > k: On satisfying this condition, we can conclude that the number ‘mid’ is smaller than our answer. So, we will eliminate the left half and consider the right half(i.e. low = mid+1).
- Otherwise, the value mid is one of the possible answers. But we want the minimum value. So, we will eliminate the right half and consider the left half(i.e. high = mid-1).

- Finally, outside the loop, we will return the value of low as the pointer will be pointing to the answer.
