# Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA)

## What is DSA?
DSA stands for **Data Structures and Algorithms**.  
It is the foundation of computer programming — it helps us store, organize, and process data efficiently.

## 1. Data Structure (DS)

### Definition:
A **Data Structure** is a way to store and organize data in a computer so it can be used efficiently.

### Types of Data Structures:
1. **Linear Data Structures** – elements are arranged in a sequence  
   - Array  
   - Linked List  
   - Stack  
   - Queue

2. **Non-Linear Data Structures** – elements are connected in a hierarchical way  
   - Tree  
   - Graph

3. **Hash-based Data Structures**  
   - Hash Table / Hash Map

---

## 2. Algorithm (Algo)

### Definition:
An **Algorithm** is a step-by-step procedure or set of rules to solve a problem or perform a task.

### Examples:
- Searching an element → Linear Search, Binary Search  
- Sorting elements → Bubble Sort, Merge Sort, Quick Sort  
- Graph traversal → DFS, BFS

## 3. Time Complexity

### Definition:
Time complexity measures how long an algorithm takes to run as the input size increases.

### Common Time Complexities:
--------------------------------------------------------------
| Complexity  | Meaning          |   Example                  |
|-------------|------------------|----------------------------|
| O(1)        | Constant time    | Accessing an array element |
| O(log n)    | Logarithmic time | Binary Search              |
| O(n)        | Linear time      | Linear Search              |
| O(n log n)  | Log-linear time  | Merge Sort                 |
| O(n²)       | Quadratic time   | Bubble Sort                |
--------------------------------------------------------------



## 4. Space Complexity

### Definition:
Space complexity measures the total memory space required by an algorithm, including input and auxiliary space.

### Example:
If an algorithm uses an extra array of size `n`,  
its **space complexity = O(n)**.
